              SplitClub was founded in 2024 by a team of entrepreneurs who noticed a growing problem: valuable digital subscriptions and memberships were going unused while others couldn't afford them. We believed there had to be a better way to connect people who have unused benefits with those who could use them.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              What started as a simple idea between friends has grown into a thriving community marketplace that's helping thousands of people save money while reducing digital waste. We're proud to be building something that makes premium services more accessible while fostering genuine connections between community members.
